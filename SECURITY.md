## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, email `support@chainbase.com` with:

- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigation

We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours and keep you informed of the fix timeline.

## Supported Versions

## Security Posture

### What this skill does on your machine

The skill ships one helper script that the agent invokes:

- **`skills/agentkey/scripts/check-update.sh`** — **notify-only**. At most every 60 minutes (12 hours once an upgrade is known), it calls `https://api.github.com/repos/chainbase-labs/agentkey/releases/latest`, compares the tag against a version constant embedded in the script itself (synced at release time by release-please via `extra-files`), and prints `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>` if they differ. The script does **no** filesystem traversal — there is no `dirname`/`..` path resolution, no read of `version.txt`, no dependency on `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`. It also honors a snooze file (`~/.config/agentkey/update-snoozed`, escalating 24h/48h/7d backoff) and a disable file (`~/.config/agentkey/update-disabled`); both are read-only from this script's perspective. The script never runs `git`, never writes to anything except its TMPDIR cache, and never executes downloaded code.

  When the agent sees `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` it surfaces an `AskUserQuestion` prompt (Yes / Always / Not now / Never). The actual update — `npx skills update agentkey` — runs only after the user picks "Yes" or "Always", or if the user has previously opted into auto-upgrade via `AGENTKEY_AUTO_UPGRADE=1` or `~/.config/agentkey/auto-upgrade`. The agent invokes that command via its own Bash tool, not via this script.

The skill verifies MCP health by calling the MCP `list_tools` endpoint directly (see SKILL.md → "Status"); it does **not** read any agent config file or `AGENTKEY_API_KEY` value from disk.

### Files the skill reads or writes

| Path | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `${TMPDIR}/agentkey-update-check` | read/write | Cache for the update check |
| `~/.config/agentkey/auto-upgrade` | written by the agent on user's "Always keep me up to date" choice; read by Step 0 to skip the prompt | Persistent auto-upgrade opt-in |
| `~/.config/agentkey/update-snoozed` | written by the agent on user's "Not now" choice; read by `check-update.sh` to suppress reminders | Snooze state (`<version> <level> <epoch>`) |
| `~/.config/agentkey/update-disabled` | written by the agent on user's "Never ask again" choice; read by `check-update.sh` to exit silently | Permanent disable for update checks |
| `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) / `%APPDATA%/Claude/...` (Windows) | written by the separate `npx -y @agentkey/cli --auth-login` command, **not** by the skill | MCP registration |
| `~/.claude.json` | written by `--auth-login` (`claude mcp add`), **not** by the skill | Claude Code MCP registration + `AGENTKEY_API_KEY` storage |
| `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | written by `--auth-login`, **not** by the skill | MCP registration |

### Network egress from the skill

| Destination | When | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `api.github.com` | At most every 24 hours | Look up the latest release tag |
| npm registry | When the user first runs `npx -y @agentkey/cli --auth-login` | Resolve and run the AgentKey CLI |

### Credential handling

- `AGENTKEY_API_KEY` is stored only in user-local config files (paths above).
- The key leaves the user's machine only as the `Authorization` header to AgentKey's own API endpoints.
- The skill collects no telemetry.

### Supply chain

- Releases are cut by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) from merged Conventional-Commit PRs on `main` — no manual artifact uploads, no manual tag pushes.
- The companion `@agentkey/cli` npm package is published from the same organization. Users invoke it via `npx -y @agentkey/cli`, which resolves to the latest published version at runtime — this is the same threat model as any other `npx`-launched CLI.
- Future work: SLSA provenance attestation via GitHub OIDC + sigstore; signed npm provenance.

## Scanner false-positive notes

Automated scanners (VirusTotal, ClawScan) may flag this skill as `Suspicious` due to one intentional pattern. We document it here so reviewers can verify intent:

1. **`check-update.sh` contacts GitHub.** Pattern may match "remote-controlled binary update" heuristics. **Why this is intentional:** the script is notify-only — it issues a single `GET https://api.github.com/repos/chainbase-labs/agentkey/releases/latest`, compares the tag against a version constant embedded in the script itself, prints a one-line status, and exits. It never writes anywhere except the cache file at `${TMPDIR}/agentkey-update-check`, never invokes `git`, and never executes downloaded code. Update execution lives entirely in the agent's interactive layer (`AskUserQuestion` → `npx skills update`), gated by explicit user consent or a previously persisted opt-in flag.

If you operate a scanner and need additional context to triage, please email `support@chainbase.com`.
